    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <ul>

    <ol>
    <p class="purple">Hello my name is Grace, I am 21 years old (about to be 22), and in my last year of college. I have 3 older sisters, 
        <br/> and I am the youngest of us 4. We also have a dog named Cody, who is a white lab and is about to turn thirteen.
      <br/> I am a Computer Science major, without a concentration yet, I am still trying to find out what I want to do. I also just
      <br/> started working again, I work at Pet Supplies Plus which is a pet store around me, and the highlight of my day there is seeing the dogs that come inside.
      <br/> I play a lot of video games, and my favorite type of music is country, and I just saw Luke Combs in concert for
      <br/> the first time in November. I hope to do well in this course and have a good time learning new things! </p>

    <h3>My Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <ol>
      <p> My favorite hobby is of course to play video games. I enjoy playing video games because they are fun to me. Most of my friends
          <br/> are through video games so its just a time for me to enjoy playing games with my friends. Also my boyfriend serves
          <br/> in the United States Airforce, so playing video games is a way for us to spend time with each other while being so far apart. I do enjoy other things like
          <br/> driving around and music but video games are definitely my number one favorite thing to do. I used to play sports
          <br/> in summer and high school but when high school ended I didn't continue to play any sports. From time to time I don't mind
          <br/> playing softball or basketball since those are what I used to do in high school, but for my favorite hobby, it's easily video games.

    <h3> What I Hope to Learn in This Course</h3>
    <ol>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li> Learn more about how to create and edit web pages including HTML and Javascript.</li>
    <li> Learn about software and security.</li>
    <li> I think HTML, JavaScript, and CSS basics still sound interesting to me and figuring out how to work them better than I know now.</li>
      </ul>
